# Machine Learning Case Study: Iris Species Classification Using Decision Tree Algorithm:

This repository contains a Machine Learning case study that focuses on the classification of Iris flower species using the Decision Tree algorithm. The project aims to demonstrate how Decision Trees can be applied to effectively classify different types of Iris flowers based on their petal and sepal characteristics.

## Overview

The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in the field of Machine Learning and is often used for practice and educational purposes. It consists of 150 samples from each of three Iris species (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). For each sample, four features are measured:

1. Sepal length in centimeters
2. Sepal width in centimeters
3. Petal length in centimeters
4. Petal width in centimeters

The goal of this project is to build a Decision Tree model that can accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species based on these four features.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the Iris dataset (CSV file) used for training and testing the model.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Python source code for the Decision Tree model.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python libraries and dependencies required for running the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-species-classification.git

## 1.Navigate to the project directory.
cd iris-species-classification
## 2.Install the required Python packages by running:

3.Open the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to explore the dataset and the model development process.
4.Run the Decision Tree model from the src/ directory to classify Iris species.
